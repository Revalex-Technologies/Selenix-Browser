# Contributor License Agreement for Selenix

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Selenix Browser (“Project”).

This project is based on the Wexond browser source code and is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0). All contributions to this Project must also be licensed under GPL-3.0 to ensure compatibility.

By submitting any code, documentation, designs, or other materials (collectively, “Contribution(s)”) to this Project, you (“Contributor”) agree to the following terms:

---

## 1. License Grant (Inbound License)

You retain ownership of your Contribution(s), but you hereby grant to the Project maintainer (Revalex Technologies) and all recipients of the Project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify, sublicense, and distribute your Contribution(s) under the same license terms as the Project (GPL-3.0).

---

## 2. Originality and Rights

You affirm and certify that:

- Each Contribution is your own original work **or** you have full rights to submit it under GPL-3.0.  
- Any third-party code included in your Contribution is GPL-compatible and properly attributed.  
- No portion of the Contribution infringes on any third-party rights, including copyright, patent, or trademark.  

---

## 3. Special Clarifications on Licensing

To avoid confusion, the following scenarios apply:

1. **Modifications or Extensions to Existing Selenix/Wexond Code**  
   - If your Contribution modifies, fixes, or extends any part of the Selenix or Wexond codebase (both licensed under GPL-3.0), your changes are considered a *derivative work* and must remain licensed under GPL-3.0 in **all forms and distributions**. You cannot relicense such derivative works under a closed-source license.

2. **Entirely New, Standalone Code**  
   - If your Contribution is completely original and not based on any Selenix/Wexond GPL code, it will still be licensed under GPL-3.0 **within this Project**.  
   - However, as the original author of that standalone code, you may reuse or dual-license it in other projects under different terms outside of this Project, provided such reuse does not incorporate any GPL-covered code from Selenix/Wexond.

## 4. Preservation of Notices

You agree not to remove or alter any copyright, license, or attribution notices in the Project or in your Contribution.

---

## 5. No Obligation to Accept

The Project maintainer is under no obligation to accept, review, or merge any submitted Contribution.

## 6. Contributor Identification

You agree that your GitHub username (and optionally your real name) may be publicly associated with your Contributions, including in commit history and attribution files.

## 7. Legal Authority

- You are legally entitled to submit your Contribution under GPL-3.0.
