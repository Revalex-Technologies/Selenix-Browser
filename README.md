Selenix is a web browser built from wexond base (the version used was prior to them closing the code), on top of modern web technologies such as `Electron` and `React`, that can also be used as a framework to create a custom web browser (see the [License](#license) section).

## Motivation

The Wexond team discontinued and later sold their project some time ago. I have always admired their work, and this repository is an effort to build upon it while staying within legal and licensing requirements. Specifically, this project is based on a commit tagged **v5.2.0** in the original repository, which included the GPL license file. That version can be found [here](https://github.com/wexond/browser-base/tree/v5.2.0).  

As developers, many of us have attempted to compile Chromium from source, only to find the process extremely time-consuming and resource-intensive. **Selenix** aims to address that challenge by leveraging the foundation provided by Wexondâ€™s project, now updated to support modern Node.js and Electron versions.  

# Features

- **selenix Shield** - Browse the web without any ads and don't allow websites to track you. Thanks to the selenix Shield powered by [ghostery](https://github.com/ghostery/adblocker), websites can load even 8 times faster!
- **Chromium without Google services and low resources usage** - Since selenixuses Electron and wexond under the hood which is based on only several and the most important Chromium components, it's not bloated with redundant Google tracking services and others.
- **Fast and fluent UI** - The animations are really smooth and their timings are perfectly balanced.
- **Highly customizable new tab page** - Customize almost an every aspect of the new tab page!
- **Customizable browser UI** - Choose whether Selenix should have compact or normal UI.
- **Tab groups** - Easily group tabs, so it's hard to get lost.
- **Scrollable tabs**
- **chrome extensions currently do not work** - i have not updated any extension capibility of the browser yet as of writing this, i and possibly a contributer at some point may have a working extension implamentation untill then you can read the [`docs`](docs) to find out how to install extensions, old ones do work you just need to look a little harder to find them.

## Other basic features

- Downloads popup with currently downloaded items (download manager WebUI page is WIP)
- History manager
- Bookmarks bar & manager
- Settings
- Find in page
- Dark and light theme
- Omnibox with autocomplete algorithm similar to Chromium
- State of the art tab system
