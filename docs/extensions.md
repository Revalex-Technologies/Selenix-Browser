# Extensions

while Selenix does support chroome extensions it only supports the older MV2 extensions, i am currently in the process of migrating to the new MV3.

# Installing an extension

To install an extension, you will need to extract the `crx` file of the extension and put the extracted folder to `extensions` directory.

The `extensions` directory paths:
- On Linux and macOS: `~/.selenix/extensions`
- On Windows: `%USERPROFILE%/.selenix/extensions`
